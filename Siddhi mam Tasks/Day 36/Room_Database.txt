Room Database

-Room provides a structured way to define your database schema, 
 which is basically the blueprint for how your data is organized.

- With Room, you can easily perform operations like storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data in your app. 
  It also helps manage things like data consistency and performance, so your app runs smoothly.

- In simple words, Room database is like a smart storage system for your app's data, 
  making it easier for you to manage and work with information within your Android app.

- Room reduces boilerplate code, improves code readability, and helps manage database-related tasks efficiently.

- It simplifies the process of working with databases in Android apps by offering three main components:

CONCLUSION = IT IS USED TO SAVE THE DATA IN DATABASE THAT IS LOCAL STORAGE NOT ON THE SERVER

======================================================================================================================================================================

1) Entity: 

 An entity represents a table in the database. It's like defining the structure of your data. 
 Each entity class corresponds to a table that means one class one table , and each field in the class represents a column in that table.

2) DAO (Data Access Object): 
  DAOs are interfaces or abstract classes where you define methods to interact with your database. 
  These methods specify the SQL queries needed to perform operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data from the database.

3) Database: 
 The database is a container for all the tables defined as entities and serves as the main access point for the underlying SQLite database. 
  It's where you define the database's version number and specify which entities are included.
