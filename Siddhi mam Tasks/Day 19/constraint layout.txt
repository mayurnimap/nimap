Constraint Layout
-it is a view group  that is view that holds other view
-it was discovered in 2016
-It was created to help reduce the nesting of views and also improve the performance of layout files.
-it is the more flexible version of relative layout
-in present situation it has just replace the relative layout
-so the main advantae of constraint layout is that it adapts the screen size of any phone and tablet..
-for that we have to use the constraint layout as per use such as if we have made the view in the centre of the screen then we have to 
 constraint it from horizontally and vertically...
-there are many attributes in this layout such as for horizontaly there is start_to_start_of then end_to_end_of and for vertically top_to_topof and bottom_to_bottomof
-constraint layout reduced the need of nested layouts
-Bias attributes allow you to specify a percentage bias for a view. For example, you can horizontally bias a view to be 30% from the left edge.
-Constraint Layout often leads to flatter and more optimized view hierarchies compared to nested layouts, improving performance.
-there is also baseline constraint which is use to bring the two view at same level..



Notes :

match-constraint or 0dp
-for this example try to learna again or insted go to start horizontal weight layout

==================================================================================================================================================================


constraint_dimensionration : w.16:9
-w mean width gets adjusted and h means hight gets adjusted.
-we can see the result in landscape and normal mode

==================================================================================================================================================================

constraint_horizontal_chainstyle = "packed" or "spread" or "spread inside"
-in if there are three buttons then we can placed them equally in length if they are horizontally constraint with one another for that we have to give spread attribute
- in packed they stick with one another
- and in spread inside right and left buttons will be at the edge and centre button will in the centre.

==================================================================================================================================================================

 app:layout_constraintVertical_bias="0.2"
- above command says that it will placed 20% belove it constraint means whichever constraint we have assigend to it..

=======================================================================================================================================


start_toendof and end_tostartof
-if there are two buttons 1 and 2 and if we type in first button start_toendof (id 2) then it will place just after the id 2
-if tere are two buttons and if we type second button end_tostartof (id 1) then it will placed just before the 1 button..

==================================================================================================================================================================

horizontal weight and vertical weight
-to distrubute the weight accordingly that is two give three element equal space


==================================================================================================================================================================

guidlines
-look at the layout for better understading

================================================================================================================================================================

android:ems="5"
-In this example, the width of the EditText will be approximately 5 times the width of the letter "m" in the font, and it will adjust dynamically based on the length of the text it contains.
-it is very useful when we are getting the text because it will automatic set the text 10 times more than it...
