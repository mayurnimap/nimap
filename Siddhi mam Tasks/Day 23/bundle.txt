bundle :
-bundle passing means the data that we are passing is in key value pair.
-for eg we have created the app putextra stuff and all.
-Bundle passing is a common technique used in Android development to pass data between different components, such as activities or fragments. 
 It allows you to package data into a Bundle object and send it along with an Intent or as arguments to a fragment..



Think of a Bundle as a small container or a bag that you can use to carry some items (data) from one place to another within your Android app. 
Here are some key points about Bundles in simple terms:

1)Purpose: Bundles are used to pass data between different components of an Android app, such as activities or fragments.

2)Container: A Bundle is like a bag where you can put different types of data, such as strings, integers, or objects.

3)Key-Value Pair: Each piece of data in a Bundle is stored with a unique identifier called a "key." This key helps you retrieve the data later.

4)Usage: You create a Bundle, put your data inside it along with their keys, and then send this Bundle along with an Intent (for activities) or as arguments (for fragments).

5)Retrieving Data: When the receiving component (like another activity or fragment) receives the Bundle, it can extract the data using the keys provided.

conclusion = in bundle we can store all the data just like storing data in bag and then we can passed it in intent.

in bundle we used putString() method to add data  |  in bundle we used getStringExtra()  method retrive the data in second activity
in intent we used putExtra() method to add data     |  in intent we used putExtra() method retrive the data in second activity
