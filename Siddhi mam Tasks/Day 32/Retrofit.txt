Retrofit
- Retrofit is a handy tool that makes it simple for your Android app to talk to the internet and get the data it needs, 
  while keeping your app safe, fast, and easy to build. 
- Retrofit makes it easy for your Android app to talk to the internet and get data from web servers.
- When you get data from the internet (like JSON), Retrofit helps you turn it into usable information for your app using GsonconverterFactory 
  It also helps you send data back to the server in the right format .
- It can handle getting data from the internet without slowing down your app. 
- Whether you're making a small app for yourself or a big app for lots of people, Retrofit can handle it. 
  It's easy to use for simple projects and powerful enough for complex ones.

Steps for making the Retrofit
- first u have to add the depedencies in gradle built section
- then an android manifest file add permissio of internet
- then we make a model class (Constrcutor, getters and setters)
- use the same variable and names as web servers/api for better functioning
- if we use other names then we should use serializedname tag
- then make the retrofit class and make static method of retrofit  in where we are return the api interface
- in that method make the object for retrofit..

public class Retrofitclient {

    private static final String BASE_URL = "https://gorest.co.in/";
    private static Retrofit retrofit = null;

    public static Apiinterface getRetrofitClient()
    {
        if(retrofit==null)
        {
            retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
                    .baseUrl(BASE_URL).addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create()).build();
        }

        return retrofit.create(Apiinterface.class);
    }
}

- then make the interface and in that interface use the get method and remaining url because in 
  retrofit class last line we are returning retrofit including apiinterface that mean remaning url in it.

- lastly if u have used the recycler view then make the adapter for it.....
