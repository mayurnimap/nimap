Activity lifecycle

1)Creation: When an Activity is first launched or brought back from the background, the onCreate() method is called. 
                   This is where initialization tasks like setting up the user interface and preparing resources occur.

2)Starting: After onCreate(), the Activity enters the Started state. Here, it becomes visible to the user, but it's not yet in focus. 
                  The onStart() method is called during this phase.

3)Resuming: When the Activity comes into the foreground and becomes interactive, it enters the Resumed state. 
                     The onResume() method is called, and this is where you typically register listeners or resume animations.

4)Paused: If another Activity comes into the foreground, partially covering the current one, the current Activity enters the Paused state. 
                The onPause() method is called, and it's a good place to save user data or stop animations that consume resources.

5)Stopped: If the Activity is completely hidden by another Activity or if the user navigates away from it, it enters the Stopped state. 
                  The onStop() method is called, and you can release resources that are not needed while the Activity is not visible.

6)Destroyed: When the system is low on memory or if the user finishes the Activity, it enters the Destroyed state. 
                     The onDestroy() method is called, allowing you to release resources like network connections or unregister broadcast receivers.

7) The onRestart() method is one of the callback methods in the Android Activity lifecycle. 
    It's called when an Activity is being restarted after being stopped but before it becomes visible to the user again. 
   This method is typically invoked when the user navigates back to the Activity from another Activity that was stopped or paused.
