 Some Important Points About Fragment In Android:

1. Fragments were added in Honeycomb version of Android i.e  API version 11.

2. Android Fragment is the part of activity, it is also known as sub-activity.

3. There can be more than one fragment in an activity. Fragments represent multiple screen inside one activity.

4. We can add, replace or remove Fragment’s in an Activity while the activity is running.
   For performing these operations we need a Layout(Relative Layout, FrameLayout or any other layout) in xml file and then replace 
   that layout with the required Fragment.

5. The FragmentManager class is responsible to make interaction between fragment objects.

6. Each fragment has its own life cycle methods that is affected by activity life cycle because fragments are embedded in activity.

 Need Of Fragments In Android:

-Before the introduction of Fragment’s we can only show a single Activity on the screen at one given point of time so 
 we were not able to divide the screen and control different parts separately. With the help of Fragment’s we can divide 
 the screens in different parts and controls different parts separately.

-By using Fragments we can comprise multiple Fragments in a single Activity. Fragments have their own events, layouts and complete life cycle. 
 It provide flexibility and also removed the limitation of single Activity on the screen at a time.

=======================================================================================================

 Fragments were added in in Honeycomb version of Android i.e  API version 11. There are some primary classes related to Fragment’s are:

1. Fragment: The base class for all Fragment definitions

2. FragmentManager: The class for interacting with Fragment objects inside an activity

3. FragmentTransaction: The class for performing an atomic set of Fragment operations such as Replace or Add a Fragment.
