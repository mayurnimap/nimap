Component of android
-there are 4 major components of android
 1) Activities
 2) Services
 3) Broadcast and Receivers
 4) Content Providers

1) Activity -
   - An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface in an Android application.
   - Activities are the building blocks of Android UI, providing a window in which you can place your UI components.
   -They are responsible for interacting with the user and handling user events. 
   - Activities can be thought of as individual tasks that users perform, such as composing an email, browsing the web, or viewing a photo gallery.
   - Each Activity has its lifecycle methods (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy()) 
     that are called by the Android system as the activity transitions between different states.
   - Activities are typically defined in the AndroidManifest.xml file and can be launched individually or in sequence as part of a task.

2) Services
  - a service is a component that runs in the background to perform long
    running operations.
  - Unlike Activities, Services don't have a user interface, and they run independently of the application's lifecycle.
  - Services are often used for tasks that need to continue running even when the user switches to another application or when the application is in the background.
  - Common use cases for services include playing music in the background, downloading files, or performing network operations.
  - Services have their lifecycle methods (onCreate(), onStartCommand(), onBind(), onUnbind(), onDestroy()) that govern their behavior and execution.
  - After creating a service's Java/Kotlin file, it should also be declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file to be recognized by the Android system.

  

3) Broadcast  Receivers
 - Broadcast in android is the system-wide events that can occur when the device starts, when a message is received on the device or 
   when incoming calls are received, or when a device goes to airplane mode, etc.
 - Broadcast Receivers are used to respond to these system-wide events.
 - Broadcast Receivers allow us to register for the system and application events, and when that event happens, then the register receivers get notified
 - There are mainly two types of Broadcast Receivers:
                                            I)  Static Broadcast Receivers: These types of Receivers are declared in the manifest file and works even if the app is closed.
                                            II) Dynamic Broadcast Receivers: These types of receivers work only if the app is active or minimized.
 - Since from API Level 26, most of the broadcast can only be caught by the dynamic receiver

4) Content providers
 - a content provider component supplies the data from one application to other
 - with the help of it one app can access the data of another app 
 - Content Providers offer a standard interface for CRUD operations.
- They are commonly used for accessing common data such as contacts, media files, or structured data in databases. 
 - such request are handle by the method of contentResolver class
