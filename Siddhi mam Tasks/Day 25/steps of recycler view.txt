Steps for Recycler View
-in main xml file just drag the recycler view there
-then create the layout of our choice such as for contact one image and name then image and name should be in linear and orientation should be horizontal
-then we should create new class and that class should extends to Recyclerview with the datatype <classname.MyviewHolder>
-because we have made the class as generic then we should create the one more class inside that class and create constructor for it
-there are three methods to implement in adapter that is  1) oncreate viewholder 
                                                          2) onbind viewholder 
                                                          3) get item count
-then we should take names and images from main.java file to adapter file using constrcutor
                                                          1) we will create the constrcutor in adapter class
                                                          2) then in main file we will passed the data and in main file we will  create the constrcutor of adapter class using new keyword


                                                                    -working of method 

1)oncreate viewholder - 
 - the return type of this method is myviewholder so it will return the view
 - main working of this method is to create the view and return it to the viewholder class
 - this method return view to the viewholder class which we have made in the 4th point which we called as nested class
 - then we have to used the layout inflater to  get the data from the parent and stored it in a LayouytInflater datatype and give the variable anything
 - then use inflater.[variablename](R.layout.[xml layout file name],parent,false)
 - so in all conclusion in this method we have get the view which we have created in the layout and then return it to the MyViewHolder class 



==================================================== Myviewholder class ==============================================

- so here as we have get the view so we will find the ids of text and images whatever we have created and then stored it in variable using findviewbyid  method


========================================================================================================================
2) onbind viewholder
 -here we will use the set method for setting the text and image accroding to our layout
 -holder.img.setimage(array list variable then [position])
 -so in this we will set the images and text according to our array position


3) get item count
-here we just have to return the size if its arrat then we should return the length and if its collection then it must be size


===================================================================================================================

in main java file 
-in this first we have to find the recyclerview by using findbyid method and stored it in a variable.
- after that [variable name].setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this)):
- then [variable name].setAdapter([our created adapter name])

FOR GRID VIEW 
-we first have to create the object for GridLayoutManager such as GridLayoutManager g = new GridLayoutManager (this, 3)
- in place of 3 we can type how many columns we want in our grid view
- - after that [variable name].setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this)):
- then [variable name].setAdapter([our created adapter name])
