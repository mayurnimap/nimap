SHARED PREFERENCE

- SharedPreferences in Android Studio is a simple key-value pair storage system that allows you to store small amounts of primitive data
- Data types types such as integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc. persistently across app launches. 
- It's commonly used for storing user preferences, settings, or any other data that needs to 
  persist even if the app is closed and reopened.

STEPS FOR SHARED PREFERENCE

-SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("my_preferences", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);


// Writing data to SharedPreferences  

SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.putString("username", "john_doe");
editor.putInt("age", 25);
editor.putBoolean("is_logged_in", true);
editor.apply();

-to add the data we should always use the edit method  from share preference instance.

// Reading data from SharedPreferences

String username = sharedPreferences.getString("username", "");
int age = sharedPreferences.getInt("age", 0);
boolean isLoggedIn = sharedPreferences.getBoolean("is_logged_in", false);

-here we have use get method to read the data

// Using the retrieved data

Log.d("SharedPreferences", "Username: " + username);
Log.d("SharedPreferences", "Age: " + age);
Log.d("SharedPreferences", "Is Logged In: " + isLoggedIn);

what is synchronous ?
-when we want to execute two method and if first method is taking time to execute and because of that second method is uable to execute 
that situation is called as synchronous

what is asynchronous ?
-when we want to execute two method and that methods start to execute at the same time and whichever gives the output first that will be display then that situtation
 is called as asynchronous
