SET VALUE AND POST VALUE 

-In Android development, setValue() and postValue() are methods used to update the 
value of MutableLiveData in the ViewModel.

1)
setValue(): This method is used to set the value of MutableLiveData synchronously on the main thread. It should be called from the main thread itself. 
                     If it's called from a background thread, it will throw an exception

eg : myMutableLiveData.value = newValue

2)
postValue(): This method is used to set the value of MutableLiveData asynchronously from a background thread. It can be called from any thread, including the main thread. 
                       postValue() schedules the value to be set on the main thread at a later time. It's often used when updating LiveData from a background thread, such as inside a coroutine 
                      or a background task.

eg : myMutableLiveData.postValue(newValue)

Here's a quick summary of the differences between setValue() and postValue():

- setValue() updates the value synchronously on the main thread and should be called from the main thread itself.
- postValue() updates the value asynchronously from a background thread and can be called from any thread.

In most cases, you'll use setValue() when updating LiveData from the main thread and postValue() when updating LiveData from a background thread to ensure thread safety.
