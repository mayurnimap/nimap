OOPS : 

 - It stands for object oriented programming laguage.
 - Kotlin is considered a fully object-oriented programming language coz it does not have any static keyword
 - it helps the programmer to correlate the real world scenerios into programming world scenerios
 - there are 4 principle of oops that are -
                                                                    1) Encapsulation (getter and setter method)
                                                                    2) Inheritance
                                                                    3) Polymorphism
                                                                    4) Abstraction

1) Encapsulation
 
 - we dont set any getter and setter method then by default compiler will automatically set it
 - for further explanation go to oops project files 5

2) Inheritance

- Child class acquring the state and behaviour of parents class in know as inheritance.
- Any is the superclass of all the classes that we made in kotlin just like object class in java
- just like object it has also methods like equals,tostring and hashcode
- and we can orrride that method

3) Polymorphism
 
- in this, parents class can called the method of child class which are common
