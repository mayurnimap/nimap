GITHUB COMMANDS 

1) to copy the project from the github to local storage that is pc or laptop storage = git clone [project link] 
2) to gove to the specific folder we should use = cd [path]
3) to see the all files in the project = ls
4) to see the hidden files as well then(also we can check if there is git file or not such as .git which is hidden file when we init the repo)  = ls -a
5) to add the new repository/folder  = mkdir [name]
6) to change the name of the branch = git branch -M [new name]
7) to use only git push command instread of git push origin master = git push -u origin master (from next time only do git push it will automatially push to master branch)
8) to delete the branch  = git branch -d[branch name]
9) to see the diff between two branch that is master and dummy = git diff master (do this if ur in the dummy branch or vice versa)
10) to marge our branch with master = gir merge master (u should be in ur own branch)
11) if we have done changes in the online and we already have downloaded or clone that project in our local but now we have to make changes which have in online
      so then we should use pull command that is = git pull origin master
12) to undo the stagging chages means undo the  adding changes =  to particular file  - git reset [file name]
                                                                                                                  to all file  - git reset
13)to undo the latest commit changes  = git reset HEAD~1  
14)to see all the commit changes that we have made = git log
15) after seeing our commit changesby using git log we will get the hash of each commit there 
      then with the help of that hash we can easily undo any commit that we have made = git reset [hash]
16) to undo the chages from one commit that user has made  till the present one = git reset --hard[hash]
17) to quit the session = q

  ------------------------------------------------------TO MARGE THE CHANGES IN TO THE MAIN BRANCH------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) 1st Way


PR (pull request)
- this happens when we have done something changes in our branch and push that changes to our branch then it will create the requist in the git online
  so we should merge it with main in online section
- now even if u merge it with main in the online then u will have to pull that project into ur local project so for that u have to use = git pull origin master
-with the help of above command - main branch(online)=main branch(offline) in short our git and local projecr are sync perfectly now 

2) 2nd Way

with command
-during these there is a situatio that occurs when git is unable to automatically resolve the difference in code between two commits
 for eg suppose u r in main branch and u have made the changes in second line of code by typing mayur is king and the other  branch user has also make changes
 in the same line by typing mayu is queen then when u try to merge it with main like ( git merge main) then it will show merge conflict because git is unable to decide
 which changes he should accept
