1) Use the git fetch command to download the latest changes from the remote repository without integrating them into your local branch.
  - git fetch origin

2) After fetching changes, you can merge them into your local branch using git merge. This combines the changes from the remote branch into your current branch.
 - git merge origin/main

note : Replace main/origin with the name of the branch you want to merge changes

3) git pull origin main

4) git commit -m "Merge changes from remote repository"

5) git push origin main
